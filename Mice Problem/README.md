# Solving the Trace Length of Mice Problem with Calculus

This project was completed by **Floyd Liu** and **Winnie Shi** as part of the coursework for **Calculus III (Math 236)** at Macalester College, under the guidance of **Professor Taryn Flock**.

## Overview

This project explores a special pursuit curve problem known as the **Mice Problem**, where `n` mice start at the vertices of a regular `n`-gon and each chases the next one in a counterclockwise direction at a constant speed. The goal is to determine the path length each mouse travels before they all meet.

## Methodology

We use a variety of mathematical tools to analyze the problem, including:
- **Multivariable calculus**
- **Parametric equations**
- **Iterative approximation**
- **Limit processes**
- **Python simulations**

Our approach numerically approximates the trace length using recursive sequences and limit definitions, and compares the results with theoretical expectations derived from geometric analysis.

## Code Description

The code simulates the pursuit curve dynamics by:
- Generating a regular polygon with `n` vertices
- Iteratively moving each point toward its target
- Recording the trajectory over time
- Visualizing the curve to observe the convergence pattern

## Output

The output includes a plotted figure showing the "envelope" spiral trajectory of the mice as they converge toward the center of the polygon.

## Acknowledgment

This work is inspired by classical pursuit curve problems and builds upon known mathematical models discussed in the literature. We are grateful for the opportunity to explore these ideas through programming and calculus together.
