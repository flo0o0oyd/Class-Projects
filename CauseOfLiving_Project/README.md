# Cost of Living and Price Analysis

This project was completed as a **class project for the 155 Statistics course**.  
We analyzed how the **cost of living index** across countries is related to the **prices of essential goods** (like rice, milk, beer) and **macroeconomic indicators** such as **GDP**, **GNI**, and **PPP**.

Using R and RStudio, we built visualizations and linear models to explore which factors best explain cost of living differences. We also applied concepts from revealed-preference theory to compare consumption patterns between countries.
