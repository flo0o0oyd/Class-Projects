# Cost of Living and Price Analysis

This project explores how the **cost of living index** across countries relates to the **prices of essential goods** (like rice, milk, beer) and **macroeconomic indicators** such as **GDP**, **GNI**, and **PPP**.

We used R and RStudio to perform data analysis and linear modeling on a merged dataset of global prices and economic data. Visualizations and models were used to examine which factors best explain cost of living differences.

Inspired by revealed-preference theory, we also compared typical countries to see how price levels reflect consumption and welfare.
